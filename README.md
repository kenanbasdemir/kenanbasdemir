# 👋 Hello, I’m Kenan BAŞDEMİR! <img align="right" src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=kenanbasdemir&label=Profile%20views&color=0e75b6&style=flat" alt="kenanbasdemir" />

## 🌐 About Me

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am driven by the excitement of discovering new things in a technology-filled world. My journey in software development began in 2013, and since then, I have been focused on crafting creative and innovative solutions for every project I encounter.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a particular passion for designing scalable systems and working on cloud-based applications. Engaging with microservices architecture and container technologies has made my projects more flexible and sustainable. My interest in innovative technologies like data analytics and artificial intelligence allows me to enhance user experiences significantly.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe in the power of collaboration in the software world. Every project is a team effort, and I value the contributions of each individual, as together we create solutions that mean so much more than individual efforts. Transparent communication and an open-minded approach foster creative thinking.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In my free time, I enjoy researching new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and engaging with software communities. Learning something new every day is one of the most rewarding aspects of this journey.</p>

## 🌱 New Learnings
- **Microservices Architecture**: <p style="text-align: justify;">Breaks the application into independent services, allowing for separate development, deployment, and scaling. This provides flexibility and resilience.</p>
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: <p style="text-align: justify;">Focuses on understanding business requirements and logic to make complex systems more understandable. It offers a domain-centric modeling approach.</p>
- **Event Sourcing**: <p style="text-align: justify;">Tracks application state through events. Changes in state are recorded, allowing for reversibility and data integrity.</p>
